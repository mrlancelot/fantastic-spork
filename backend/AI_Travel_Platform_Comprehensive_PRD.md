# AI-Powered Travel Planning Platform - Comprehensive PRD
## Version 2.0 - Enhanced with Local Discovery Intelligence

**Date:** August 2025  
**Target Market:** Global (Starting with North America)  
**Development Strategy:** AI-First Architecture with Local Data Integration

---

## Executive Summary

### Product Vision
Transform travel planning into an intelligent, hyper-personalized experience that delivers authentic local insights in real-time. By combining advanced AI agents with comprehensive local data integration from platforms like Tabelog, Dianping, and regional discovery services, we create travel itineraries that feel crafted by knowledgeable locals rather than generic algorithms.

### Market Opportunity (2025)
- **AI Travel Market Size**: $487.7M (2023) → $9.8B (2033) at 35% CAGR
- **User Adoption**: 40% of travelers already using AI tools, 62% of Gen Z/Millennials actively using generative AI
- **Market Gap**: Google abandoned AI trip planner (March 2025), creating major opportunity
- **Critical Timing**: Industry experts predict 2025 as the "dam breaking" year for AI travel

### Key Differentiators
1. **Multi-source Local Data Integration**: Direct integration with regional platforms (Tabelog for Japan, Dianping for China, Naver Place for Korea)
2. **Real-time Trend Detection**: AI agents monitoring social media (51% of Gen Z prefer TikTok for local discovery), local events, and emerging hotspots
3. **Cultural Intelligence**: Understanding local customs, pricing norms, and insider preferences with cross-cultural preference modeling
4. **Adaptive Itineraries**: Plans that adjust in real-time based on weather, crowds, and availability using streaming AI responses
5. **Hybrid Architecture Advantage**: Direct Convex reads for instant UX, FastAPI writes for security - best of both worlds

## Advanced Backend Architecture Deep Dive

### Scalable FastAPI Implementation

**Production-Ready API Design**
```python
# backend/src/routes/trips.py
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException, BackgroundTasks
from ..models.trip import TripCreate, TripResponse
from ..core.security import get_current_user, require_permission
from ..core.observability import observability

router = APIRouter(prefix="/api/trips", tags=["trips"])

@router.post("/", response_model=TripResponse, status_code=201)
@require_permission(["trips:write"])
async def create_trip(
    trip_data: TripCreate,
    background_tasks: BackgroundTasks,
    user: dict = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    """Create trip with AI-powered itinerary generation"""
    async with observability.track_request("create_trip", user_id=user['user_id']):
        # Validate and create trip in Convex
        trip = await trip_service.create_trip(trip_data, user['user_id'])
        
        # Schedule AI processing in background
        background_tasks.add_task(
            generate_itinerary_async, trip.id, trip_data.preferences
        )
        
        return trip
```

### Database Performance Optimization

**Advanced Convex Schema with Compound Indexes**
```typescript
// convex/schema.ts - Performance-optimized
export default defineSchema({
  trips: defineTable({
    userId: v.string(),
    destination: v.object({
      name: v.string(),
      country: v.string(),
      coordinates: v.object({ lat: v.number(), lng: v.number() })
    }),
    dates: v.object({
      startDate: v.string(),
      endDate: v.string(),
      flexible: v.boolean()
    }),
    budget: v.object({
      amount: v.number(),
      currency: v.string(),
      breakdown: v.optional(v.object({
        accommodation: v.number(),
        food: v.number(),
        activities: v.number(),
        transport: v.number()
      }))
    }),
    status: v.string(), // draft, planning, confirmed, active, completed
    visibility: v.string(), // private, shared, public
    aiGenerated: v.boolean(),
    tags: v.array(v.string()),
    createdAt: v.number(),
    updatedAt: v.number()
  })
  // Compound indexes for efficient queries
  .index("by_user_created", ["userId", "createdAt"])
  .index("by_user_status", ["userId", "status"])
  .index("by_destination_country", ["destination.country", "createdAt"])
  .index("by_status_dates", ["status", "dates.startDate"])
  .searchIndex("search_destinations", {
    searchField: "destination.name",
    filterFields: ["userId", "status", "destination.country"]
  })
});
```

### Security Architecture with Clerk

**Advanced Permission System**
```python
# backend/src/core/security.py
class SecurityManager:
    """Advanced security with role-based permissions"""
    
    PERMISSION_HIERARCHY = {
        "admin": ["trips:*", "users:*", "ai:*", "analytics:*"],
        "premium": ["trips:read", "trips:write", "trips:delete", "ai:chat", "export:advanced"],
        "basic": ["trips:read", "trips:write", "ai:chat:limited"],
        "free": ["trips:read:limited", "ai:chat:basic"]
    }
    
    async def check_permission(self, user_role: str, required_permission: str) -> bool:
        """Check if user role has required permission"""
        user_permissions = self.PERMISSION_HIERARCHY.get(user_role, [])
        
        # Check for exact match or wildcard
        for permission in user_permissions:
            if permission == required_permission:
                return True
            if permission.endswith(":*") and required_permission.startswith(permission[:-1]):
                return True
        
        return False
```
